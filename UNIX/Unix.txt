DOS- Disk Operating System
UNIX - Command Line Interpreter

 Unix:
     > Management - Memory, Processor, Device, File
     > Security
     >Control Over System Performance
     >Job scheduling
     > Error Detecting

Properties:
    > can have GUI
    >forward slash (/) to seperate directories
    >Shell Script
    >Is Case-Sensitive
    >Hierarchical Model
    

UNIX Flavours/ Versions:
       AIX      - IBM
       HP Ux    - HP
       Solaris  - Sun 
       Tru64Unix- Compaq 
       TRIX     - SGI 
       SCO Unix - SCO
       Xenix    - Microsoft
       UTS      - Amdhal Corporation 
       Linux    - Red Hat


Architecture:

 Hardware  ---> Kernel --->Shell --->FTP 
                           Vi        DBMS 
                           env       Mail 
                           cut       Apps
                           which 
                           more
                           sh 
                           bash 
                           ksh 

Shell is the interaface between  Hardware and the User.

Different Shells:
   > C Shell                   - csh
   > Bourne Shell           - sh
   > Korn Shell              - ksh
   > Bourne Again Shell - bash


Organisation:

UNIX => Files => Directories ==> Tree_Like Structure(FILE_SYSTEM)

FILE_SYSTEM ----> 4 Blocks.

      1. Boot Block : Shutdown, Restart, Logoff, Switch User ...etc   

      2. Super Block: Admin info.( State of the File System, 
                                   Number of inodes, 
                                   num. of Disk blocks,
                                   Next available free blocks)

      3. Inode Block: Stores List of Nodes For all the files in a file system
                      Characteristics of Files are Pointed here.

      4. Data Block : File and Adminstrative data are stored.


Unix Command Usage:
  > Simple   : Just giving its name in cmd prompt...( Date, Cal)
  > Complex  : Command name + List of Arguments
  > Compound : list of simple or Complex command seperated by a command seperator


Internal Command             Vs         External Command

>Executed by Shell                         > By Kernel
>No Seperate Process Id for each     > Seperate Process Id
>Shell-Built in commands                > Seperate Binaries
>Faster                                          > Bit Slower.


Directory Structure:

* Upstream Directories     -  Parent / Previous directory
   Downstream Directories -  Child / Sub directory

* Start is the root(/) - base of the file system
