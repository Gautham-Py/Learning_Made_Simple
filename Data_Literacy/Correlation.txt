CORRELATION
           Correlation is used to test relationships between quantitative variables or categorical variables.
           In other words, it’s a measure of how things are related.
           The study of how variables are correlated is called correlation analysis.

Examples:

> High Correlation
            --> Caloric intake and weight.
            --> Your eye color and that of your relatives.
            --> Study time and GPA score.

> Low Correlation
            --> Sexual preference and cereal type consumed.
            --> A dog's name and their favourite treat.
            --> Cost of Car wash and Soda buying time.


THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT 
           A correlation coefficient is a way to put a value to the relationship.
           Correlation coefficients have a value of between -1 and 1.
           A “0” means there is no relationship between the variables at all, while -1 or 1 means that there is a perfect negative or positive correlation (negative or positive correlation here refers to the type of graph the relationship will produce).

TYPES:
 --> Pearson Correlation Coefficient 
     It’s used to test for linear relationships between data.
     In AP stats or elementary stats, the Pearson is likely the only one you’ll be working with.

 --> Goodman and Kruskal’s lambda coefficient
    It can be symmetric, where you do not have to specify which variable is dependent, and
    asymmetric where the dependent variable is specified.
