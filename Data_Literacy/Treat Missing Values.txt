Techniques

> Deletion:
    Unless the nature of missing data is ‘Missing completely at random’, the best avoidable method in many cases is deletion.


    --> Listwise : In this case, Rows containing missing variables are deleted. 

    --> Pairwise : In this case, Missing observations are ignored and analysis is done on
                   variables present.

> Imputation:
    
    --> Popular Averaging Techniques:  Mean, Median and Mode. (from global average for the variable to
                                                               averages based on groups)
                                    Ex: Impute 'Transaction' by Mean.
                                        Impute 'Gender' by Mode.

    --> Predictive Techniques: Assumes  that the nature of such missing observations are not completly at
                               random and the variables chosen to impute such missing observations have some
                               relation with it, else it could yeild imprecise estimates.
                               Ex: Impute 'Revenue' by Linear Regression.
