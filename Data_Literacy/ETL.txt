ETL is Extract, Transform and Load.

ETL is a process that extracts the data from different source systems, then transforms the data (like applying calculations, concatenations, etc.) and finally loads the data into the Data Warehouse system. 
The ETL process requires active inputs from various stakeholders including developers, analysts, testers, top executives and is technically challenging.

      =========================================================================================================
-----> Extraction: data is extracted from the source system into the staging area.
      =========================================================================================================
      A logical data map is created before data is extracted and loaded physically. This data map describes the relationship between sources and target data.

      Three Data Extraction methods:
      ==============================
      > Full Extraction
      > Partial Extraction- without update notification.
      > Partial Extraction- with update notification.

      Validation done during Extraction:
      > Reconcile records with the source data
      > Make sure that no spam/unwanted data loaded
      > Data type check
      > Remove all types of duplicate/fragmented data
      > Check whether all the keys are in place or not

      =========================================================================================================
-----> Transformation: process adds value and changes data such that insightful BI reports can be generated.
      =========================================================================================================
      Data that does not require any transformation is called as direct move or pass through data.
      In transformation step, you can perform customized operations on data.
      
      Validation done during Transformation:
      > Filtering : Select only certain columns to load
      > Using rules and lookup tables for Data standardization
      > Character Set Conversion and encoding handling
      > Conversion of Units of Measurements like Date Time Conversion, currency conversions etc.
      > Data threshold validation check.(Ex:age cannot be more than two digits)
      > Data flow validation from the staging area to the intermediate tables.
      > Required fields should not be left blank.
      > Cleaning (Ex: mapping NULL to 0 or Gender Male to 'M' and Female to 'F' etc)
      > Split a column into multiples and merging multiple columns into a single column.
      > Transposing rows and columns
      > Use lookups to merge data
      > Using any complex data validation (Ex: if the first two columns in a row are empty then it  
        automatically reject the row from processing)

      =========================================================================================================
-----> Loading: Optimizing, huge volume of data which needs to be loaded in a relatively short period.
      =========================================================================================================
      In case of load failure, recover mechanisms should be configured to restart from the point of failure without data integrity loss.
      Data Warehouse admins need to monitor, resume, cancel loads as per prevailing server performance.

      Three Data Loading methods:
      ==============================
      > Initial Load     : populating all the Data Warehouse tables
      > Incremental Load : applying ongoing changes as when needed periodically.
      > Full Refresh     : erasing the contents of one or more tables and reloading with fresh data.

      Load Veirification:
      > Ensure that the key field data is neither missing nor null.
      > Test modeling views based on the target tables.
      > Check that combined values and calculated measures.
      > Data checks in dimension table as well as history table.
      > Check the BI reports on the loaded fact and dimension table.
